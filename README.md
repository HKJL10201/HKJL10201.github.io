## Levi's Homepage

My name is (Levi) Taiji Li, I am a PhD student at University of Utah, started from 2021 Fall. I received my bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2021. My major is computer science, my research interests lie in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data mining, and Security. My recent research is related to smart contract security.

### Education

2021 - Present: University of Utah, PhD in computer science

2017 - 2021: South China University of Technology, BE in computer science

### Research

#### Adversarial Example Generation
- Studied and designed algorithms for adversarial example generation based on deep learning 
- Read papers related to black-box attacks, analyzed the threat of adversarial attacks
- Re-implemented methods in the papers and optimized the algorithms such as One Pixel Attack and DeepFool
- Generated adversarial samples using optimized data-free training algorithms to perform black-box attacks

#### Computer Vision Application on Edge-based Systems
- Designed computer vision applications on mobile devices for real-world scenarios
- Trained neural network models with AutoML platforms such as Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services
- Developed an Android application for handwritten character classification with 88% testing accuracy
- Developed an iOS application for allergens detection with 70% accuracy

#### Precise Ship Identification
- Developed a surveillance system to identify and locate ships in river monitoring
- Implemented incipient identification function using a pre-trained YOLOv3 model
- Improved the accuracy of ship identification to more than 75% by training with 1,617 labeled data
- Determined the locations of ships using affine projection algorithms combined with real-time GPS information
